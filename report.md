## Report
The graphs above is showing the CPU,GPU temperature as well as Memory usage compared to CPU usage of the Raspberry Pi while performing a stress test. The average temperature before compiling the kernel is 36 Degree Celcius. 
The graph above shows that while compiling the kernel, it reach around 55-60 Degree Celcius. 
The case and fan I have seem to provide good ventilation and reduce temperatures whilst underload. The graph show that the cooling helps the Pi from reaching throttle limits. 
The time to compile the kernel vary, it depends on the specs of Pi you have. 
This process takes time because of installing features, modules, and drives. User can customized these features. In this compilation, LED control is attempted but not tested
